## Coding:
The idea will follow the outline provided below and in the link. But instead of hard coding everything Imma work now to be lazy later. Nations will be made in folders; JSONs of details and images. The website will auto compute all the information and make it into a functioning website. More towards beta a tool to GUI build nations and players will be introduced. Backend will be python because I don't know anything else. The project will have a public website.

## Lore: (Note nothing has been approved)
The project will remain OOC in case something irl happens and the project must stop. But at version 1.0.0 the project will move to a IC event in which player will access it through the echo book.

# How to install:
1. Either download a zip or use git clone through a terminal
2. Add project to a coding editor such as Vscode or Vscodium
3. Use an extension or feature to run the website such as Live Server or Five Server
