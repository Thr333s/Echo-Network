## Coding:
The project will focus on implementing a dynamic and efficient approach to reduce the need for hardcoding, aiming for long-term convenience.
 - Nations will be organized into folders, utilizing JSON files to store relevant details and accompanying images for each nation.
 - An automated process will be developed to compute all the information and seamlessly convert it into a fully functional website.
 - As the project progresses towards its beta stage, a user-friendly tool will be introduced, enabling the creation of nations and players through a graphical user interface (GUI).
 - The backend of the project will be developed using the Python programming language, chosen due to the developer's proficiency and expertise in this language.
 - The ultimate goal of the project is to create a public website, allowing users to access and explore the nations and players effortlessly.

## Lore: (Note* Prone to Change)
The project will remain OOC in case something irl happens and the project must stop. But at version 1.0.0 the project will move to a IC event in which player will access it through the echo book.

### Ideas
 - Based off of forgotten magic restored by IC robot, Copper-333. Restored as he remade his home.
 - A few tinkering moments here, reapply the logic already used for the echo book.
 - Divine intervention
 - Servers and display monitors, that are wirelessly linked to Copper-333 processing system, so its all connected to Copper-333
