<!--
    History Information Page

    This page provides historical information, events, and timelines for your fictional world's nations.

    How to Add Historical Images:

    1. Prepare your image files in a suitable format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
    2. Insert your image files into the "images" directory.
    3. To display images in this "history.html" file, use the <img> HTML element with the "src" attribute set
        to the relative path of your image files.

    Example Image Insertion:

    &lt;img src="Nations/Example_Nation/images/battle.jpg" alt="Historical Battle"&gt;

    Remember to replace Example_Nation" with the actual nation name.

    NOTE: Make sure to adjust paths, names, and examples to match your project's structure and needs.
