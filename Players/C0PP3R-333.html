    <h1>Detailed physical description</h1>
    <p>
        The Copperheart stands tall, its humanoid metallic frame primarily constructed of copper, exuding a warm, lustrous glow, giving off heat to the touch. Copper plates adorned with delicate golden trim give it an air of regal elegance.
        <br><br>Etched into the chest plate of the Copperheart, there is a faded serial number, barely discernible due to the passage of time and the wear and tear endured. The number, "C0PP3R-333," serves as a testament to its origin and purpose, though its meaning remains a mystery to all but the robot itself.
        <br><br>The face of the Copperheart is positioned towards the middle of its hunched form. A yellow glowing mask, crafted with intricate patterns and detailed engravings, adorns its visage. The mask emits a soft, ethereal radiance, enhancing the robot's aura of mystery. 
        <br><br>Throughout its body, visible signs of damage and wear can be seen, remnants of the tragic events that transpired during the collapse of Coppershade. Scorch marks mar its once pristine surface, and sections of the copper plating are dented and scratched. Erosion has left its mark, uncovering layers of the Copperheart's true form, exposing the inner mechanisms and gears that lie beneath.
        <br><br>Despite the physical scars, the Copperheart moves with a grace born out of perseverance. Each step is accompanied by a faint, metallic hum, reminiscent of a resilient spirit refusing to be silenced. The exposed gears, once concealed, symbolize both vulnerability and strength, a testament to the resilience of the Copperheart's mechanical core.

    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>
        In the depths of the forgotten forge, within the desolate ruins of Wareforge, a remarkable creation was brought to life. C0PP3R-333, known as Copperheart, emerged from the ashes with a mysterious past etched into its very being. Crafted by master artisans and scholars, Copperheart was designed to be a guardian of knowledge and worker of earth. Yet, the truth of its origins remained veiled, locked away in the forgotten memories of its creators.
        <br><br>Copperheart delved into its role, diligently preserving the knowledge that lay hidden within the decaying city. But as it toiled, tragedy struck. In a cataclysmic event, the ruins of Wareforge crumbled, consumed by the merciless forces of nature. Caught in the chaos, Copperheart suffered irreparable damage, its metallic frame fractured and its purpose shattered.
        <br><br>Buried beneath layers of earth and rubble, Copperheart lay dormant for centuries, forgotten and forsaken. Time wore on, and the once-grand city faded into obscurity, its history obscured by the passage of time.
        <br><br>But fate had a different plan in store for Copperheart. Slowly, over the course of ages, the relentless erosion of wind and rain began to unveil fragments of the fallen city. Bit by bit, Copperheart emerged from its earthen tomb, partially revealed and exposed to the world once more. Til one day a white fox seeking shelter from a storm climbed onto the body of the sleeping copper machine. Through the dice of the universe the Copperheart was activated once more. Being awoken the white fox jumped off. Though instead of running, only returning to seek the warmth eminating from the reawoken machine. When the Copperheart finally opened its lenses once again, it saw the southern sky acting as a stage for the many dancing colors perfoming to it. When the machine began to move uncovering itself from the ground the white fox followed. The Copperhear then named the white fox “Aurora.”
        <br><br>It was a bittersweet resurrection for Copperheart. The passage of time had taken its toll, leaving the once-majestic automaton in a state of disrepair. Its once-glowing copper exterior had tarnished, and its intricate engravings were marred by the ravages of time. Yet, despite its damaged state, a flicker of resilience burned within Copperheart's core.
        <br><br>As it surveyed the changed world, Copperheart became to walk a new path, to rise above its shattered existence. It set forth on a journey to the world of Drevhall, seeking knowledge and understanding among its thriving inhabitants.
