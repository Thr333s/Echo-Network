                    <p> The heartlands, that's what the first Rivish settlers called this place, as it is indeed the very heart and soul of the Riverlands. Located in the dead centre of the Riverlands, the heartlands was the place where the Rivish settlers first set foot upon their arrival to Drevhall through the ancient portal, making it their new home. In fact, the heartlands isn't only the first settlement of the Rivish people, as it is also rumoured to be home to multiple ancient civilizations lost to the ages, revealed through the cataclysmic events of the great flood by the opening of the Ivy Hills ravine. </p>
                    <p> These cataclysmic events have been recorded by the outstanding Rivish cartographers, who documented the changes to the landscape of the continent by mapping out all of the Riverlands before and after the events of the great flood. These maps can be found at one of the main settlements of the Heartlands, Ivy Hills. </p>
                    <p> Being the only real housing complex in the Heartlands, Ivy hills is the first place that most newcomers visit upon their arrival to Drevhall, helping them get setup, settled and prepared to explore the rest of the world. Getting its name from the Ivy bushes that grow all over this region of the Heartlands, Ivy hills offers lodging for those seeking to either lease, or own. </p>
                    <p> Next up following Ivy Hills, the newcomer's journey would take us east, to the main attraction of the Heartlands, the Commercium. The Commercium is an iconic place in all of the Riverlands, as it is considered to be the centre of commerce, competition, and business, while also offering a variety of entertaining activities. </p>
                    <p> Directly south of the Commercium, lies one of the biggest fortresses in all of Drevhall, Fort Artem'p. While it can be used as a great defensive location, it is actually a blank canvas to any creative mind that may come across this area. </p>
                    <p>
                        And last but not least, the Maze of Doom is the last step on the Newcome's journey. This is a treacherous place, that wields great rewards. The perfect head start, as it will hone all of your survival skills, as well as provide you with immense wealth upon its completion. The maze will endure anyone brave enough to try it, the real question is, will you endure the maze…..
                        <br>
                        While the heartlands is already quite the attraction in and of itself, there's one more thing that makes it even more special than any other area within the Riverlands. As it was agreed upon by the first Rivish settlers, the heartlands is to forever remain autonomous, never to have a ruler, protecting it from any potential conflict and destruction. This makes the heartlands a great place to settle and open your business, however this may not be for everyone. Just like someone once said, where there is no risk, there's no reward…

                            The Copperheart stands tall, its humanoid metallic frame primarily constructed of copper, exuding a warm, lustrous glow, giving off heat to the touch. Copper plates adorned with delicate golden trim give it an air of regal elegance.
                            <br><br>Etched into the chest plate of the Copperheart, there is a faded serial number, barely discernible due to the passage of time and the wear and tear endured. The number, "C0PP3R-333," serves as a testament to its origin and purpose, though its meaning remains a mystery to all but the robot itself.
                            <br><br>The face of the Copperheart is positioned towards the middle of its hunched form. A yellow glowing mask, crafted with intricate patterns and detailed engravings, adorns its visage. The mask emits a soft, ethereal radiance, enhancing the robot's aura of mystery. 
                            <br><br>Throughout its body, visible signs of damage and wear can be seen, remnants of the tragic events that transpired during the collapse of Coppershade. Scorch marks mar its once pristine surface, and sections of the copper plating are dented and scratched. Erosion has left its mark, uncovering layers of the Copperheart's true form, exposing the inner mechanisms and gears that lie beneath.
                            <br><br>Despite the physical scars, the Copperheart moves with a grace born out of perseverance. Each step is accompanied by a faint, metallic hum, reminiscent of a resilient spirit refusing to be silenced. The exposed gears, once concealed, symbolize both vulnerability and strength, a testament to the resilience of the Copperheart's mechanical core.

                        <p>
                            In the depths of the forgotten forge, within the desolate ruins of Wareforge, a remarkable creation was brought to life. C0PP3R-333, known as Copperheart, emerged from the ashes with a mysterious past etched into its very being. Crafted by master artisans and scholars, Copperheart was designed to be a guardian of knowledge and worker of earth. Yet, the truth of its origins remained veiled, locked away in the forgotten memories of its creators.
                            <br><br>Copperheart delved into its role, diligently preserving the knowledge that lay hidden within the decaying city. But as it toiled, tragedy struck. In a cataclysmic event, the ruins of Wareforge crumbled, consumed by the merciless forces of nature. Caught in the chaos, Copperheart suffered irreparable damage, its metallic frame fractured and its purpose shattered.
                            <br><br>Buried beneath layers of earth and rubble, Copperheart lay dormant for centuries, forgotten and forsaken. Time wore on, and the once-grand city faded into obscurity, its history obscured by the passage of time.
                            <br><br>But fate had a different plan in store for Copperheart. Slowly, over the course of ages, the relentless erosion of wind and rain began to unveil fragments of the fallen city. Bit by bit, Copperheart emerged from its earthen tomb, partially revealed and exposed to the world once more. Til one day a white fox seeking shelter from a storm climbed onto the body of the sleeping copper machine. Through the dice of the universe the Copperheart was activated once more. Being awoken the white fox jumped off. Though instead of running, only returning to seek the warmth eminating from the reawoken machine. When the Copperheart finally opened its lenses once again, it saw the southern sky acting as a stage for the many dancing colors perfoming to it. When the machine began to move uncovering itself from the ground the white fox followed. The Copperhear then named the white fox “Aurora.”
                            <br><br>It was a bittersweet resurrection for Copperheart. The passage of time had taken its toll, leaving the once-majestic automaton in a state of disrepair. Its once-glowing copper exterior had tarnished, and its intricate engravings were marred by the ravages of time. Yet, despite its damaged state, a flicker of resilience burned within Copperheart's core.
                            <br><br>As it surveyed the changed world, Copperheart became to walk a new path, to rise above its shattered existence. It set forth on a journey to the world of Drevhall, seeking knowledge and understanding among its thriving inhabitants.
